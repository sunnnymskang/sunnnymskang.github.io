excerpt: "As a machine learning scientist, I developed and deployed AI algorithms for hit-identification and property predictions. 
Here are the details of each project.

**Hit-ID** <br>
To improve the existing deep-learning based regression model,
So I started by curating some new benchmarks to evaluate the model to assess their failure modes: I curated, two new benchmarks- allosteric 
inhibitors and activity cliffs. From this I showed that the model's performance degraded for novel binding pockets as well as on the pair of molecules having non-linear structure- activity relationship.
To make upgrades to the model, I firstly re-wrote and  re-organized the code base to make it more modular, amenable to test and debug and deployable to the cloud infrastructure. 

**Property Prediction**<br>
Besides the hit-id effort, I’ve developed an algorithm that predicts various properties of the drug using transfer learning 
techniques. For this I trained graph-based transformer pretrains,  language based transformer, and simple neural network applied to morgan
fingerprint.
