title: "1D Convolutional neural nets for inferring distance from time series records of Bluetooth signals"
excerpt: "
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed to several projects and tech consortiums aimed at addressing critical public
health challenges. One of the key areas I focused on was contact tracing. Since COVID-19 spreads through airborne particles
and droplets, tracing the movements of exposed individuals became crucial to control transmission.
Bluetooth-enabled phones were identified as a promising tool for this, as the signal strength between two devices typically
correlates with their distance. However, the relationship between signal strength and distance is noisy, influenced by factors
such as the angle between devices and phone manufacturing differences. To address these challenges, I collaborated with
researchers at MIT PathCheck to develop an AI model capable of predicting close proximity between devices, considering
Bluetooth signals and other confounding factors. Our model placed third in a competition hosted by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST), and we coauthored a paper detailing the model, which was accepted at the Machine
Learning for Mobile Health Workshop at NeurIPS. The model was implemented in the PathCheck app, which has been adopted
by governments in Minnesota, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, Teton County, Wyoming, and Cyprus.
