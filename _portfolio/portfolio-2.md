title: "1D Convolutional neural nets for inferring distance from time series records of Bluetooth signals"
excerpt: "Since Covid-19, I’ve been part of the proximity sensing research team at PathCheck foundation. 
The team recently participated in the [TC4TL challenge](http://tc4tlchallenge.nist.gov/). For this challenge, I built 
three variations of 1D convolutional neural networks that learns the distance between two Blue-tooth enabled devices from the noisy signal: [arXiv](/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3) [link to code](https://github.com/sunnnymskang/NIST_BLE_challenge) "
