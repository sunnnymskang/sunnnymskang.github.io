# Hi I’m Sunny 
<br/>
I build and apply computational methods for designing new therapeutics at Relay Therapeutics. In my role, I leverage a range of computational methods—including molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics (QM), cheminformatics, and AI/ML—to design drugs of various modalities. I’ve worked on designing small molecules, peptides, macrocycles and nano-bodies.Before Relay, I was a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at Immuneering where I developed deep learning algorithms for small molecule hit discovery and property prediction.

Before Relay, I was a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at Immuneering where I developed and deployed deep learning algorithms for small molecule hit discovery and property prediction.

I earned my Ph.D. studying computational vaccine design where I developed stochastic simulations to make HIV vaccines more potent. Translated to the language of drug discovery, my work can be best described as Pk/PD modeling of vaccine-induced immunity.

While working in the vaccine space, I cultivated interest in   legal landscape of access to life saving HIV medicines. Subsequently, I interned and consulted at UNDP where I supported team’s initiatives in reviewing intellectual property laws in low and middle income countries so that their access to HIV treatments expand. I continued my advocacy work for access to health care at GAiA - a non-profit at Berkman Klein Center in Harvard.

Outside of work, I contributed to two open source projects:  [PathCheck](https://pathcheck.org/) and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/)
and has been a reviewr for Neurips Dataset and Benchmarks Track since 2021.
