# Hi I’m Sunny 
<br/>
I want to build robust, interpretable and fair algorithms to promote human health and social goods.
I earned my Ph.D. studying computational vaccine design. I applied principles from Statistical Physics and leveraged 
stochastic simulation techniques to make HIV vaccines more potent.
Currently, I am a senior data scientist on the Pricing and Algorithms team at [Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/). 
In addition, I contribute as a Research Scientist at [PathCheck](https://pathcheck.org/) foundation - a MIT-based non-profit tech consortium for COVID-19.
