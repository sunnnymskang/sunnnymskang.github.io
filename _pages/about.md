# Hi I’m Sunny 
<br/>
I want to build robust, interpretable and fair algorithms to promote human health and social goods.
I earned my Ph.D. studying computational vaccine design where I applied principles from Statistical Physics and leveraged 
stochastic simulation techniques to make HIV vaccines more potent. In the meantime, I interned and consulted at UNDP where I supported team's initiatives
for revising and repealing intellectual property laws that prevents access to HIV treatments in low and middle income countries. I continued my advocacy work
for access to health care at GAiA - a non-profit at Berkman Klein Center in Harvard. 

Currently, I am a Senior Data Scientist on the Pricing and Algorithms team at [Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/). 
In addition, I contribute as a Research Scientist at [PathCheck](https://pathcheck.org/) Foundation - a MIT-based non-profit tech consortium for COVID-19.
