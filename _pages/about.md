# Hi I’m Sunny 
I want to build robust, interpretable and fair algorithms to promote human health and social goods.
Currently, I am a senior data scientist at Wayfair and a contributing research scientist at PathCheck foundation.  

I got my Ph.D. in studying how a vaccine could maximize antibody responses by engineering its scheduling. 
Together with with experimental collaborators, we identified a new cellular mechanism that can potentially amplify 
antibody responses upto 20 times in titers.  Based on the mechanistic understanding, 
I built a stochastic system that simulates our body’s antibody responses from a vaccine. 

While I was academically seeking to uncover a mechanism on cellular level, I was also curious about macroscopic mechanisms
 that are in place to control epidemics. My internship and consultancy at United Nations Development Program (UNDP) was a 
 time that I learned about what and how legal and policy levers determine the public’s  access to treatments and vaccines. 
 During my time, I supported projects for revising and repealing the intellectual property laws and the trade policies 
 that impede access to medicines to patients in low and middle income countries. After UNDP, I continued my advocacy work 
 at GAiA - a non-profit at Bekrman Klein Center at Harvard, with an increased focus in advocating for policy solutions that are practical 
 for existing drug development process and for US regulatory landscape.
