# Hi I’m Sunny 
<br/>
I build and apply computational methods for designing new therapeutics at Relay Therapeutics.
In my role, I leverage a range of computational methods—including molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics (QM), cheminformatics, and AI/ML—to identify the most effective approach for the specific modalities I work with.   

Before Relay, I was a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at Immuneering where I developed deep learning algorithms for small molecule hit discovery and property prediction.

I earned my Ph.D. studying computational vaccine design where I developed stochastic simulations to make HIV vaccines more potent. Looking back, (after having spent brief seconds in drug discovery) my work can be described as Pk/PD modeling of vaccine-induced immunity. 
In the meantime, I interned and consulted at UNDP where I supported team's initiatives
in reviewing intellectual property laws in low and middle income countries so that their access to HIV treatments expand. I continued my advocacy work
for access to health care at GAiA - a non-profit at Berkman Klein Center in Harvard. 

Outside of work, I contributed to two open source projects:  [PathCheck](https://pathcheck.org/) and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/)
and has been a reviewr for Neurips Dataset and Benchmarks Track since 2021.
