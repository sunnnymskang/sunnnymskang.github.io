# Hi I’m Sunny 
<br/>
I want to build robust, interpretable and fair algorithms to promote human health and social goods.
I studied computational vaccine design during my Ph.D. during which I applied theories in statistical physics and 
leveraged stochastic simulation techniques for designing more potent HIV vaccine.
Currently, I am a senior data scientist at Wayfair and a contributing research scientist at PathCheck foundation.
