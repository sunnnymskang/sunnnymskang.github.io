title: "Sustained antigen availability during germinal center initiation enhances antibody responses to vaccination"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We explored the effect of nontraditional vaccine dosing profiles on antibody titers of vaccines and discovered that certain dosing profiles demonstrate >10-fold higher antibody production than the traditional single-dose prime–boost method. We also present a computational model that captures the experimental results and provides a mechanistic understanding of the biology behind the effectiveness of our strategy. This work has clinical significance in vaccine design because it is a simple method to increase the efficacy of subunit vaccines, which may lead to the development of efficacious vaccines for diseases such as HIV.'
