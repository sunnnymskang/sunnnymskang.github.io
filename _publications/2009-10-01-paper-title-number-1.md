Natural infections expose the immune system to escalating antigen
and inflammation over days to weeks, whereas nonlive vaccines are
single bolus events. We explored whether the immune system
responds optimally to antigen kinetics most similar to replicating
infections, rather than a bolus dose. Using HIV antigens, we found
that administering a given total dose of antigen and adjuvant over
1–2 wk through repeated injections or osmotic pumps enhanced
humoral responses, with exponentially increasing (exp-inc) dosing
profiles eliciting >10-fold increases in antibody production relative
to bolus vaccination post prime. Computational modeling of the germinal center response suggested that antigen availability as higheraffinity antibodies evolve enhances antigen capture in lymph nodes.
Consistent with these predictions, we found that exp-inc dosing led
to prolonged antigen retention in lymph nodes and increased Tfh cell
and germinal center B-cell numbers. Thus, regulating the antigen and
adjuvant kinetics may enable increased vaccine potency.
